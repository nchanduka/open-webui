This repository contains helm charts adapted to be deployed on PCAI.

Each framework has its own folder with the following content:

a logo of the framework, to be used during the import process
a x.y.z folder, relative to a specific version of the framework
a porting.md file, describing how the framework has been ported to PCAI
a FRAMEWORK-x.y.z.tar.gz file, which is the tar/gz file of the previous folder and FRAMEWORK is the name of the containing folder
